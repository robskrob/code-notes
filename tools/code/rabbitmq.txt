Best pracitce for Rabbit MQ

Queues:

- queue names should be named after what the consumer/worker will do with the messages on the queue.
  - what is the intetn of the operation for this queue?
    - example: sendNotification; the naming convention makes it easy to review or undestand what the purpose of the queue is.
  - messages could have many different routing keys but the actions for the message can be shared.
- do not name the queue after the binding, the routing key. 
- keep queue names decoupled from the exchange and routing key of the message. 
- make sure queues stay short. Longer queues impose more processing overhead. 
- prefetch states that a queue will limit what it sends to a consumer based on an acknowledged message count. Once this count of unacknowledged messages are met, the queue stops sending messages. 
- user a large prefetch count. Small values hurt performance; it forces queues to persist messages and grow in size. 

Channel:

- every channel in RabbitMQ is an Erlang process and so is every queue. 

Exchange:

- Topic:
  - these types of exchanges are slower than direct or fanout.
